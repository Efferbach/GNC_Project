The UAV frontend is treated as a triangle to simplify area calculations
No slip stream since the UAV is mostly flat in the z direction
Only calculations for the linear part of the angle of attack (AOA)


Ask about aerodynamic center for calculations for the pitching moment
Ask about the moment moved by the r vector
Ask about coefficients
